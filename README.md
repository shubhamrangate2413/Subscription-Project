# Subscription-Project

Subscription products often serve as the primary revenue source for companies across various industries. These products can take the form of all-encompassing subscriptions or multi-level memberships. Regardless of their structure or industry, companies consistently aim to minimize customer churn (i.e., subscription cancellations). To retain customers, they must first identify behavioral patterns that contribute to disengagement with the product.

Target:
The target audience comprises the entire company’s subscription base—those customers they want to retain.
Product:
Existing subscription products can offer value that users may not have imagined or may have forgotten.

# Goal:
The objective of this model is to predict which users are likely to churn. Companies can then focus on re-engaging these users with the product. Efforts may include email reminders about product benefits, especially highlighting new features or features the user values.
We have used Logistic regression for this analysis.
